        "#Q1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "Ans: Interpreted languages are executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime, translating source code into machine code on the fly. They are generally more portable because the same source code can be run on any platform with the appropriate interpreter. However, they tend to be slower due to the overhead of runtime translation. Errors are detected at runtime, which means the program may run until it encounters an error. Examples include Python and JavaScript.\n",
        "\n",
        "Compiled languages are translated into machine code by a compiler before execution, creating an executable file. This machine code is specific to the target platform, making compiled languages less portable. However, they tend to be faster because the machine code is executed directly by the hardware without the need for runtime translation. Errors are detected at compile-time, which means the program will not run until all errors are fixed. Examples include C and C++.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "Ans: Exception handling in Python allows you to manage runtime errors gracefully using try, except, else, and finally blocks. This mechanism helps prevent program crashes and ensures proper resource management. The try block contains code that might raise an exception, the except block handles the exception if it occurs, the else block executes code if no exceptions occur, and the finally block executes code regardless of whether an exception occurs.\n",

        "Ans: The finally block ensures that code runs regardless of whether an exception occurs. It is used for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources. This guarantees that important cleanup tasks are always performed, even if an error occurs. The finally block is particularly useful for resource management, ensuring that resources are properly released even if an error occurs.\n",

        "Ans: Logging is a way to track events that happen when software runs. The logging module provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs. It helps in debugging, monitoring, and understanding the flow of a program by recording significant events. Logging can be configured to output messages to different destinations, such as the console or a file, and at different levels of severity, such as DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.\n",

        "Ans: The _ _ del _ _ method is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used to clean up resources like closing files or network connections. This method ensures that any necessary finalization is performed before the object is removed from memory. The _ _ del _ _ method is also known as a destructor and is useful for managing resources that need to be explicitly released when an object is no longer needed.\n",

        "\n",
        "**from import:** Imports specific attributes or functions from a module, allowing direct access without module qualification. This can make the code cleaner and more readable.\n",

        "#Q7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "Ans: Use multiple except blocks or a single except block with a tuple of exceptions. This allows handling different types of exceptions separately or together, providing more control over error handling. Multiple except blocks can be used to handle different exceptions in different ways, while a single except block with a tuple can handle multiple exceptions in the same way.\n",

        "Ans: The with statement ensures proper acquisition and release of resources. It is commonly used with file operations to ensure files are properly closed, even if an error occurs. This helps prevent resource leaks and ensures that files are always properly managed. The with statement simplifies resource management by automatically handling the setup and teardown of resources.\n",

        "Ans: Logging helps in debugging and monitoring the application by providing a record of runtime events. It allows developers to track the flow of the program and identify issues, making it easier to maintain and troubleshoot the application.

        "#Q11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "Ans: Memory management in Python involves the allocation and deallocation of memory to ensure efficient use of resources and prevent memory leaks. Python uses automatic memory management, including garbage collection, to handle memory allocation and deallocation. The garbage collector automatically identifies and frees unused objects, helping to manage memory efficiently and prevent memory leaks.\n",

        "Ans: Identify risky code, handle exceptions, execute alternative code, and clean up using try, except, else, and finally blocks. This structured approach ensures that errors are managed gracefully and resources are properly released. The try block contains code that might raise an exception, the except block handles the exception if it occurs, the else block executes code if no exceptions occur, and the finally block executes code regardless of whether an exception occurs.\n",

        "Ans: Memory management is crucial to prevent memory leaks and ensure efficient use of resources, which helps maintain application performance. Proper memory management ensures that the application runs smoothly without consuming excessive memory. By managing memory efficiently, developers can prevent memory-related issues, such as crashes and slow performance, and ensure that the application remains stable and responsive.\n",

        "\n",
        "**except:** Handles the exception if it occurs. This structure allows for graceful error handling and ensures that the program can continue running or terminate gracefully.

        "#Q15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "Ans: Python's garbage collection system automatically deallocates memory by identifying and freeing unused objects using reference counting and cyclic garbage collector. This helps manage memory efficiently and prevents memory leaks. The garbage collector tracks the number of references to each object and frees objects that are no longer referenced. It also detects and collects cyclic references, which are groups of objects that reference each other but are not reachable from the rest of the program.\n",

        "#Q16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "Ans: The else block executes code if no exceptions occur in the try block, allowing for clean separation of normal and exceptional code paths. This helps in organizing code and making it more readable and maintainable. The else block is useful for code that should only run if no exceptions occur, providing a clear distinction between normal and exceptional code paths.\n",

        "Ans: The common logging levels are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL, each indicating the severity of the log messages. These levels help categorize log messages and control the output based on the importance of the events. DEBUG is used for detailed diagnostic information, INFO for general information, WARNING for potential issues, ERROR for errors that prevent the program from continuing, and CRITICAL for severe errors that may cause the program to terminate.\n",

        "Ans: **os.fork():** Creates a new process by duplicating the current process. It is available on Unix-like systems and is useful for creating child processes that run concurrently with the parent process. However, it can be complex to manage and is not available on all platforms.\n",
        "\n",
        "**multiprocessing:** Module to create processes with separate memory space, providing a higher-level interface for process creation and management. The multiprocessing module is platform-independent and provides a simpler and more flexible way to create and manage processes, making it easier to write cross-platform code.\n",

        "Ans: Closing a file ensures that data is written and resources are released, preventing data corruption and resource leaks. It is a crucial step in file handling to maintain data integrity and system stability. When a file is closed, any buffered data is written to the file, and the file descriptor is released, making it available for other processes. Failing to close a file can lead to data loss, resource exhaustion, and other issues.\n",
